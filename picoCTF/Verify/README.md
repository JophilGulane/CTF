# Description
People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.
# Solution 1
+ You can use [sha256sum files/*] and compare it to [checksum.txt] using grep to find the right file and then use decrypt to get the flag.
# Solution 2
+ You can use for loop and apply decrypt and grep to find the flag.
