## CATEGORIES

### Cryptography
Challenges involving the use of encryption and decryption techniques. Participants must break ciphers, decode messages, or otherwise manipulate cryptographic algorithms to retrieve hidden information or flags.

### Exploit
Challenges that require finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, binaries, or applications. These could involve buffer overflows, shellcode execution, or other forms of software exploitation.

### Forensics
Tasks that involve analyzing digital evidence to uncover clues and retrieve flags. This might include examining file metadata, recovering deleted files, or analyzing memory dumps and network traffic.

### Investigation
Challenges focused on information gathering and analysis. Participants may need to investigate specific scenarios, follow digital trails, or gather intelligence to solve the puzzle.

### Miscellaneous
A catch-all category for challenges that don't fit neatly into other categories. These can include logic puzzles, steganography, or any other unique or unconventional problems.

### Programming
Tasks that require writing code to solve a specific problem. These challenges may involve algorithm development, automating tasks, or performing computations to find the flag.

### Reverse Engineering
Challenges that require understanding and deconstructing compiled code to find vulnerabilities or hidden information. This often involves analyzing binaries, assembly code, or disassembling software to retrieve the flag.

### Web
Challenges focused on web technologies and security. Participants might exploit vulnerabilities in websites or web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or authentication bypass techniques.
